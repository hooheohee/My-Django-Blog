	<p class="article-content">
		This was my very first experience with Django. I started it on May 1st, 2019, completed all the basic functions on May 10th, 2019, and finally got it deployed on May 15th, 2019. I also did a Flask version of it. <br>
		I want to express my gratitude to Corey Schafer, who has been posting awesome Python related tutorials in his Youtube channel. They have been very helpful to me. <br>
		This website is part of my practice in learning Python and Django. By no means is it in commercial use. <br>
