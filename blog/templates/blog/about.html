	<p class="article-content">
		I'm a second year Information Systems graduate student at Northeastern University. I have been looking for a co-op job for two months and have had no luck so far. Now that the summer break has begun, apart from practicing the leetcode problems, I decided to learn something new such as Django, Flask, SQL and ASP.NET. <br><br>
		This is my very first experience with Django. I started it on May 1st, 2019 and completed all the basic functions and get it deployed on May 10th, 2019. I also did a Flask version of it. <br><br>
		I want to express my gratitude to Corey Schafer, who posts awesome Python related tutorials on his Youtube channel. They have been very helpful to me.
